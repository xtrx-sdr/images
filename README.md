# XTRX FPGA images & pre-compiled binaries

This repository hosts FPGA images and pre-compiled binaries for XTRX. Only rev4 hardware and Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 binaries are published at this moment, that works well on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 as well.

NOTE: We're phasing out XTRX rev3 (pre-crowdfunding prototypes) hardware support. Please [contact us](https://xtrx.io/contact/)  to get support.

Please report any problems running pre-compiled libraries from this repository directly this repo's [issues](https://github.com/xtrx-sdr/images/issues).

## Structure
 - `binaries` - pre-compiled host binary packages.
 - `sources` - reference source code used for building the binaries. Uses git submodules to reference to the relevant git repositories. See *Manual Compilation* for more details.
 - `firmware` - FPGA images for reflashing. (not yet published)

## Pre-built packages

 - [Alpine Linux](https://github.com/aports-ugly/aports/tree/master/ugly/libxtrx)
 - [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=xtrx)
 - [openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/hardware:sdr)
 - [Ubuntu 18.04](https://launchpad.net/~fairwaves/+archive/ubuntu/xtrx)

## Manual compilation of host libraries from the `sources` directory

You need C and C++ compiler to build host libraries. `libusb1` is also required if you're using a USB3 adapter. For Debian-based systems:
```
% sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake dkms python-cheetah python
``` 
For Ubuntu 18.04 system you need to install Python 2.7 since python-cheetah is only available for 2.7

First, you need to clone relevant revisions of source modules:
```
% git submodule init
% git submodule update
```
Now enter the `sources` directory and run:
```
% cd sources
% mkdir -p build
% cd build
% cmake ..
OR if you don't want SoapySDR support:
% cmake -DENABLE_SOAPY=NO ..
% make
```
When everything is built you can install them:
```
% sudo make install
% sudo ldconfig
```

### PCIe kernel driver compilation

If you're connecting XTRX over a (mini)PCIe bus, you also need to install a kernel driver. 

The easiest way is to use DKMS.

First, make sure DKMS can find the driver sources. `make install` above will install the driver sources into `/usr/local/src` while DKMS expect them in `/usr/src`, so you should create a symlink:
```
% sudo ln -s /usr/local/src/xtrx-0.0.1-2/ /usr/src/
```

And now instruct DKMS to build the module:
```
% sudo /usr/sbin/dkms add -m xtrx -v "0.0.1-2"
% sudo /usr/sbin/dkms build -m xtrx -v "0.0.1-2"
% sudo /usr/sbin/dkms install -m xtrx -v "0.0.1-2"
```

If everything goes well, you can now load the driver:
```
modprobe xtrx
```
and it should appear in `/proc/modules` with relevant messages in `dmesg`.

In case you face any issues with DKMS, [please report the issue](https://github.com/xtrx-sdr/images/issues). Meantime, you should be able to build the driver manually. Enter the `sources/xtrx_linux_pcie_drv` directory and run:
```
% make
% sudo insmod xtrx.ko
```
### Non-root access for /dev/xtrx0

If you want to access XTRX from non-root user (which is the typical case), you need to install `udev` rules. 
```
cp sources/xtrx_linux_pcie_drv/50-xtrx.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```
After that, you need to restart `udevd` and remove and insert the XTRX driver (`rmmod xtrx; modprobe xtrx`) or reboot the system. On ubuntu-like systems, you can restart `udev` by
```
udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
```

# Getting started
## Working with XTRX over PCIe bus
PCIe device ID is `10ee:7012`:
```
% lspci -v -d 10ee:
01:00.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 7012
    Subsystem: Xilinx Corporation Device 0007
    Flags: fast devsel, IRQ 255
    Memory at 91510000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled] [size=4K]
    Memory at 91500000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled] [size=64K]
    Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 3
    Capabilities: [48] MSI: Enable- Count=1/4 Maskable- 64bit+
    Capabilities: [60] Express Endpoint, MSI 03
    Capabilities: [100] Device Serial Number 00-00-00-00-12-34-56-78
```

If driver `xtrx` is loaded correctly, a character device `/dev/xtrx0` should appear.


## Working with the USB3 adapter
USB3 adapter should appear on your system as USB device `0525:3380`. Check it by running `lsusb`:
```
% lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0525:3380 Netchip Technology, Inc. 
```

## Testing if XTRX is alive
Run this command to check that your XTRX is connected properly and is not dead:
```
% test_xtrx -t -l2
```

The output should be like this
```
CPU Features: SSE2+ SSE4.1+ AVX+ FMA+
Master: 31999999.863761; RX rate: 3999999.982970; TX rate: 0.000000

# FAQ
## I don't see XTRX in `lspci` output
If XTRX is installed into a miniPCIe slot and an LED near the edge of XTRX is blinking with the ON-OFF-ON-OFF-.. pattern with ~3sec period,  it means XTRX hasn't been enumerated on the PCIe bus.

Make sure that the miniPCIe slot has PCIe lanes routed. Some systems use miniPCIe slots to connect USB-only devices and do not route PCIe lanes of the miniPCIe slot. In this case, you can try XTRX with other miniPCIe slots.

In all other cases, feel free to [contact us](https://xtrx.io/contact/).

## Which board/laptop can I use with XTRX in PCIe mode?
**You can use any board/laptop with XTRX with a USB3 adapter. Below assumes that you want to use XTRX in PCIe mode**

Generally, your board should have the miniPCIe socket **with the PCI lane**. Most laptops don't work, since generally they have PCI lane only on half-sized miniPCIe sockets (used for WiFi devices) while full-sized sockets designed mostly for use with SATA and USB lanes only. Industrial SBCs frequently have at least one such socket thus are more suitable for XTRX.

## XTRX installed into a miniPCIe slot prevents the system from booting (don't even get to BIOS)
This problem can happen if your motherboard provides SMB signals to the miniPCIe connector. Most systems don't. The XTRX rev.4 use reserved pins that are held in hi-Z state. However, during the startup, DC/DC chip isn't initialized, and XTRX is pulling down the SMB DATA line, which is often connected to chips critical for the system booting. We're working on a firmware fix, but currently, hardware modification (cutting the fuse on the bottom side of XTRX near the edge as pictured below) is the only solution.
Cut the fuse pictured below with a sharp knife. Make sure you do not use much pressure, or you can accidentally cut other traces.

## I connected XTRX directly via micro-USB cable, and I don't see it `lsusb` 
Unfortunately, USB2 PHY software isn't ready yet. Check issue [#9](https://github.com/xtrx-sdr/images/issues/9) for more details and suggestions.

## Is Windows driver support planned?
We plan to add Windows PCIe drivers, but we don't have a specific schedule for this right now. If it's blocking factor, please [contact us](https://xtrx.io/contact/). However, all other software layers are windows compatible, and USB3380 adapter should work via WinUSB.

## I've got a DMA buffer issue on my ARM device
You should probably increase DMA coherent pool using `coherent_pool=32M` kernel option in case you see the following lines in the `dmesg` output:
```
[ 7.171608] xtrx: Failed to allocate 31 DMA buffer
[ 7.171632] xtrx 0000:01:00.0: Failed to register TX DMA buffers.
```
For the details, see issue [#37](https://github.com/xtrx-sdr/images/issues/37).

## How to use XTRX GPS to receive NMEA data and PPS signal?

Prerequisites:
1. You should connect XTRX with miniPCIe or PCIe since USB3 libs [don't expose GPS interface](#can-xtrx-gps-be-accessed-through-usb3) to the system.
2. Make sure that XTRX PCIe drivers are installed. You don't need XTRX libraries since it solely depends on kernel devices and `gpsd`/`pps-tools` software.

To receive GPS NMEA data like current time and geoposition:
1. Connect the GPS antenna to XTRX and ensure there is clear sky visibility to acquire GPS signal. Note that coated glass windows may completely block GPS signal, so we recommend putting the GPS antenna outside of a window if you're testing indoors.
2. Install `gpsd` and `gpsd-clients` packages (for example, for Ubuntu: `apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients`).
3. Run `gpsd` with `/dev/ttyXTRX0` specified as the device. In Debian-based distros you can specify device path in `/etc/default/gpsd` file and restart `gpsd` service). Otherwise, you can run it with device path as the last CLI argument: `sudo gpsd -D 5 -N -n /dev/ttyXTRX0`.
4. Run `cgps` to see the NMEA data coming from the XTRX GPS unit, as well as it's decoding into a date, time, and geopositioning.

To test PPS (aka [Pulse-per-second signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal)):
1. Connect the antenna as described for the NMEA testing above.
2. Install `pps-tools`.
3. Run `sudo ppstest /dev/pps0`. Note, if you have more than one PPS device, you can find correct one using, for an instance, `sudo dmesg | grep xtrx_pps` command, just take `ppsN` from the output where `N` is a number, and use it as device's filename in the `/dev` synthetic file system. On successful receiving of PPS signal, you'll see lines like this: `source 0 - assert 1560521435.029030769, sequence: 615 - clear  0.000000000, sequence: 0`.

## Can I access XTRX GPS through USB3?
Currently, XTRX GPS can be accessed only through PCIe. There are only four USB endpoints available with the USB3 adapter, and SDR part of XTRX uses two of them. So only two USB endpoints are available while USB serial normally requires three USB endpoints. This can potentially be resolved by writing a custom kernel driver - contributions are welcome if someone wants to do that!
